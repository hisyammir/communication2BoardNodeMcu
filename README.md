# Communication 2 Board NodeMCU ESP8266

Try to make Wi-Fi Communication Client-Server between two boards NodeMCU ESP8266.

One ESP8266 as an AP (Access Point) and another ESP8266 as a Client. Then, the server and the client will echange data (potentiometer readings) via HTTP request.

## Getting Started

There are several libraries required:

- ESPAsyncWebServer library
- ESPAsync TCP library
- Adafruit SSD1306
- Adafruit GFX Library

Next, I will upload the schematic diagram and the device architecture. :)
